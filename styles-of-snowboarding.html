                <p>
                    "Jibbing" is the term for technical riding on non-standard surfaces, 
                    which usually includes performing tricks. The word "jib" is both a 
                    noun and a verb, depending on the usage of the word. As a noun: 
                    a jib includes metal rails, boxes, benches, concrete ledges, walls, 
                    vehicles, rocks and logs. As a verb: to jib is referring to the action 
                    of jumping, sliding or riding on top of objects other than snow.
                     It is directly influenced by grinding a skateboard. 
                     Jibbing is a freestyle snowboarding technique of riding. 
                     Typically jibbing occurs in a snowboard resort park but can 
                     also be done in urban environments.

                    Freeriding is a style without a set of governing rules or set 
                    course, typically on natural, un-groomed terrain. The basic 
                    allows for various snowboarding styles in a fluid motion and 
                    spontaneity through naturally rugged terrain. It can be 
                    similar to freestyle with the exception that no man-made 
                    features are utilized. See also Backcountry snowboarding.

                    Freestyle snowboarding is any riding that includes performing tricks. 
                    In freestyle, the rider utilizes natural and man-made features such 
                    as rails, jumps, boxes, and innumerable others to perform tricks. 
                    It is a popular all-inclusive concept that distinguishes the 
                    creative aspects of snowboarding, in contrast to a style like 
                    alpine snowboarding.

                <p>
                    Alpine snowboarding is a discipline within the sport of snowboarding. 
                    It is practiced on groomed pistes. 
                    It has been an Olympic event since 1998.
                    Sometimes called freecarving, this takes place on hard packed 
                    snow or groomed runs and focuses on carving linked turns, much like 
                    surfing or longboarding. Little or no jumping takes place in this discipline.

                <p>
                    Competitors perform tricks while descending a course, moving around, 
                    over, across, up, or down terrain features. The course is full of 
                    obstacles including boxes, rails, jumps, jibs, or anything else 
                    the board or rider can slide across. Slopestyle is a judged event
                     and winning a slopestyle contest usually comes from successfully 
                     executing the most difficult line in the terrain park while having 
                     a smooth flowing line of difficult, mistake-free tricks performed 
                     on the obstacles. However, overall impression and style can play 
                     factor in winning a slopestyle contest and the rider who lands 
                     the hardest tricks will not always win over the rider who lands
                      easier tricks on more difficult paths.

                <p>
                    Big air competitions are contests where riders perform tricks after
                    launching off a man made jump built specifically for the event.
                    Competitors perform tricks in the air, aiming to attain sizable 
                    height and distance, all while securing a clean landing. Many 
                    competitions also require the rider to do a complex trick. 
                    But not all competitions call for a trick to win the gold; 
                    some intermittent competitions are based solely on height and 
                    distance of the launch of the snowboarder. Some competitions 
                    also require the rider to do a specific trick to win the major prize.
                    One of the first snowboard competitions where Travis Rice attempted
                    and landed a "double back flip backside 180" took place at the 2006
                    Red Bull Gap Session.

                    The half-pipe is a semi-circular ditch dug into the mountain or
                     purpose-built ramp made up of snow, with walls between 8 and 
                     23 feet (7.0 m). Competitors perform tricks while going from 
                     one side to the other and while in the air above the sides of 
                     the pipe.

                    Boardercross, also known as "Boarder X" and "Snowboard X", is a 
                    very popular but relatively recent winter sport, starting in the 
                    1980s and earning its place as an official Winter Olympic sport 
                    in the 2006 Turin games. In Boardercross, several riders 
                    (usually 4 to 6) race down a course similar to a motorcycle 
                    motocross track (with jumps, berms and other obstacles constructed
                    out of snow on a downhill course). Unlike traditional head-to-head
                    races, competitors use the same terrain, sometimes resulting in
                    accidental collisions.

                    In snowboard racing, riders must complete a downhill course 
                    constructed of a series of turning indicators (gates) placed
                     in the snow at prescribed distances apart. A gate consists 
                     of a tall pole, and a short pole, connected by a triangular
                      panel. The racer must pass around the short side of the gate. 
                      There are 3 main formats used in snowboard racing including; 
                      single person, parallel courses or multiple people on the 
                      course at the same time.
